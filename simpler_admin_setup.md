# Creating an Admin User in Supabase

Follow these steps to create an admin user and set up the necessary tables correctly:

## Step 1: Create a User in Supabase Auth

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to "Authentication" â†’ "Users"
4. Click "Add User" 
5. Enter the email and password for your admin user
6. After creating the user, note the UUID (it will look like `0cd7562d-ba7e-49b9-a4c3-e44a1528a4c0`)

## Step 2: Set Up Database Tables Using SQL Editor

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to "SQL Editor"
2. Create a new query
3. Copy and paste the following SQL:

```sql
-- First, drop the tables with foreign key constraints first
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS admin_users;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;

-- Create or recreate the users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create or recreate the admin_users table
CREATE TABLE admin_users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'manager')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

4. Click "Run" to execute the SQL and set up your tables

## Step 3: Add Your Admin User to Both Tables

1. In the SQL Editor, create another new query
2. Replace the placeholders with your actual values in the following SQL:

```sql
-- Insert user into the users table
INSERT INTO users (id, email) 
VALUES ('YOUR-USER-UUID', 'admin@example.com');

-- Insert admin into the admin_users table
INSERT INTO admin_users (id, email, name, role) 
VALUES ('YOUR-USER-UUID', 'admin@example.com', 'Admin User', 'admin');
```

3. Replace:
   - `YOUR-USER-UUID` with the UUID from Step 1
   - `admin@example.com` with your admin email
   - `Admin User` with your admin name
   - `admin` with the role (admin or manager)
   
4. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

## Step 4: Verify Your Setup

1. Go to the "Table Editor" in Supabase
2. Check the "users" and "admin_users" tables to confirm your user is in both
3. You should now be able to log in with your admin credentials

## Important Notes

- The SQL drops and recreates the tables. If you have existing data, modify the script to preserve it.
- Be careful with the UUID; it must be exactly the same as the one from Supabase Auth.
- If you get a foreign key constraint error, make sure the UUID exists in the users table first.
